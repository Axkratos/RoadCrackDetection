# Anugaman - Road Crack Detection System

Anugaman is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to detect road cracks using AI-powered image analysis. This project integrates a machine learning model with a user-friendly mobile interface to provide instant diagnosis of road surface defects, offering repair solutions to enhance road safety and maintenance.

## üöÄ Problem Statement

Road infrastructure maintenance is crucial for safety and efficiency. Traditional methods of road inspection are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often subjective. Anugaman aims to:

- **Automate Road Inspection**: Use AI to detect cracks and defects in road surfaces quickly and accurately.
- **Provide Repair Solutions**: Offer immediate repair recommendations to address identified issues.
- **Improve Safety**: Enhance road safety by identifying potential hazards before they become critical.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Solves the Problem

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes a fine-tuned DenseNet161 model to classify road cracks with high precision.
- **Mobile Interface**: Provides an intuitive Flutter UI for capturing or uploading road images for analysis.
- **Backend Integration**: A FastAPI server handles image uploads, model predictions, and returns results in JSON format.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users receive instant feedback on crack types and repair solutions, enabling proactive maintenance.
